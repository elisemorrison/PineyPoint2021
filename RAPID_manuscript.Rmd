## Abstract

In spring 2021, a failure of the liner at the Piney Point facility, a decommissioned fertilizer facility, prompted the controlled release of an estimated 215 million gallons of untreated water into Tampa Bay, from March 29th to April 9th. Here, we address the following research questions: (1) What was the effect of the N- and P-rich discharge on nutrient cycling within Tampa Bay; (2) What changes in phytoplankton community composition and trophic status were seen over the course of the summer, following the discharge? Here, we address these questions through the evaluation of water column nutrients, phytoplankton community analysis, and stable isotopes of particulate organic matter, seagrasses, and macroalgae, coupled with continuous water quality measurements. Four sites were selected for continuous monitoring and included a region adjacent to the discharge site (Piney Point), two back bay regions, one of which was a site of previous discharge in 2003 (Bishop Harbor and Joe Bay), and one reference site located outside of the bay (St. Joseph Sound).

## Introduction
TODO: details about facility, region, past studies of phytoplankton communities, nutrients

Multiple stable isotopes can provide information regarding the source and processing of elements in the environment.

## Methods

### Bulk measures
  Particulate organic matter (POM) was collected on pre-combusted 25mm diameter glass fiber filters (GF/F). Seagrass and macroalgae tissues were rinsed with deionized water after collection, and then frozen. Tissues and filters were freeze dried then analyzed for total carbon, total nitrogen, delta 13C, and d15N.

  Certified analyses were conducted at the University of Florida's Analytical Research Laboratory for total phosphorus (TP), orthophosphate (SRP), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonium (NH4) and nitrate+nitrite (NOx).

### Bulk measures
There were distinct differences in bulk measures over the study period. 

When d13C and 15N POM isotope values were compared with a bi-plot, there is a convergence of the stable isotope values of the offshore site, with signatures very similar to those of the Piney Point effluent. (Figure 2)
